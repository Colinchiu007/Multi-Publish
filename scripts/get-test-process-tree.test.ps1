# Regression tests for scripts/get-test-process-tree.ps1
#
# Scope: the PID-reuse guard. The CI call sites (Gate 4 / Desktop shards) feed the result
# straight into `taskkill /T /F`, so a false positive is not just a red check - it aims a
# force-kill at OS-critical processes. Measured on run 36519025075 attempt 1: all 12517 tests
# passed, yet the walk reported csrss.exe / winlogon.exe / fontdrvhost.exe / dwm.exe as leaked
# test children, because the root pnpm PID had been recycled and those boot-time processes
# record that number as their ParentProcessId.
#
# Everything here runs against an injected process table, so it is deterministic and touches no
# real process. Case 6 is the anti-blindness assertion: with the guard switched off the SAME
# fixture must reproduce the false positive, otherwise the fixture proves nothing.
#
# Comments stay ASCII: BOM-less UTF-8 .ps1 files are decoded as ANSI by Windows PowerShell 5.1.
